Stretch Questions


  1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
      -> Inline:
          - CanNOT change width and height.
          - Does not fill parent container and thus does not move down to a new line.
      -> Block:
          - Can change width and height, and margins and padding.
          - By default, moves to a new line.
          - Fills parent container.

  2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
      -> It is positioned relative to the nearest ancestor or relatively positioned parent element.

  3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
      -> display: inline-block;

  4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
      -> <div> <p> <h1>
      -> <a> <span>
      -> <button>

  5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
      -> It is a model for computing how margin, padding, etc. are added to an element. By default, it ADDS whatever padding you set for an element to the total size of that element. (ie. If you have a box that you gave a width and height of 100px, and you add padding of 20px to it, the box is now 140px in width and height)...
      -> To fix this, add a box-sizing of border-box to the page via the universal selector:
          - EXAMPLE: * {
                      box-sizing: border-box;
                    }
